# Disaster Recovery Plan for this Architecture
---

## 1. Introduction
Boto3 facilitates the creation and management of AWS resources such as VPCs, EC2 instances, security groups, subnets, and internet gateways through modularized Python scripts.

## 2. Objectives

- Ensure rapid recovery of critical AWS infrastructure components managed by the SDK in the event of a disaster.
- Minimize downtime and data loss to maintain business continuity.
- Establish clear procedures and responsibilities 

## 3. Backup Strategy

### Configurations:

- **Frequency**: Automatically back up SDK configuration files and scripts to a version-controlled repository. (Single Source of Truth!!!)
- **Retention**: Retain multiple versions of configuration files to revert to previous stable versions if necessary.

### Data Backup:
- **EC2 Instance Data**: Use AWS EBS snapshots for critical EC2 instance data.
- **Database Backups**: If applicable, implement automated backups for databases used by the SDK.

### Disaster Recovery Assets:
- Store backup artifacts such as AWS CloudFormation templates or Terraform configurations in a secure location.
